"""Shared rich console.

The console is used for the output of scripts and examples; library code logs
instead of printing, see `sbmlsim.log`.

```python
from sbmlsim.console import console

console.print(result)
console.rule("Section", style="white")
```

Importing this module has no side effects on the interpreter. To get rich
representations in an interactive session, install them explicitly with
`rich.pretty.install()`.
