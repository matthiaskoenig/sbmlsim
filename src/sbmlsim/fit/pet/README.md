# PE-Tab support

https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation_data_format.html


## Issues
### Time-dependent conditions:
* support of time-dependent conditions: https://github.com/PEtab-dev/PEtab/issues/540
* https://github.com/dilpath/petab_timecourse: Basically not developed/maintained any more?
* => Events solution, i.e. create an SBML for the different simulation scenarios

* - injecting piecewise function

### Weighting of data
* => currently via the SD scaling

### amounts/concentrations in SBML
- setting amounts and concentrations as initial conditions => precalculate the calculations
- accessing amounts and concentrations in parameter fitting; => add observables if necessary;
